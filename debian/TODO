GD packaging hall of shame:
  * Convince these source package to support the noxpm variant of GD2:
    + php4
    + libgd-ruby
    + gnustep-gd
    + gdtclft
    + dvipng
    + cl-gd
    + apcupsd
    + bandwidthd
    + mapserver
    + cl-gd
    + m17n-lib
    + mrtg
    + php5
    + png2html
    + sarg
    + bioperl
    + ircmarkers
    + libchart-strip-perl
    + remstats
    + piwi
    For comparison, these source packages correctly support noxpm:
    + pygdchart2 (not yet officially released for Debian)
    + libgdchart-gd2
    + wims (but there are other problems - see below)
    + webdruid
    + webalizer
    + rscheme
    + python-gd
    + plplot
    + ploticus
    + nagios
    + modlogan
    + g2
    + bogl
    + gnuplot
    + cvsgraph
    + analog
    + rrdtool
    + enscribe
    + graphviz
    + ntop
    + faqomatic
    + libchart-perl
    + shanty
    + springgraph
    + weathermap4rrd
    + bugzilla
    And these depend on X11 libs anyway so makes sense to only use -xpm:
    + mldonkey
    + nut (but why - it is a web app with only CGI interface?!?)
  * Convince these source packages to switch to GD v2:
    And solve issues with these:
    + wims (flydraw and texgd needlessly depends on both v1 and v2)
    + libgd-text-perl (needlessly depends on both v1 and v2)
    + remstats (favors v1)
    For comparison, these source packages correctly depend only on v1:
    + libgd-perl (v2 variant packaged too: libgd-gd2-perl)
    + libgd-noxpm-perl (v2 variant packaged too: libgd-gd2-noxpm-perl)
    + python-gdchart (v2 variant being prepared: pygdchart2)
    + libgdchart-gd1 (v2 variant packaged too: libgdchart-gd2)

Post sarge:
  * Switch to using cdbs (too tricky while two branches)
  * Rename the -noxpm packages to -nobloat?

Related work:
  * Adopt libgd-gif and merge with libgd (the gif patent is no more).
